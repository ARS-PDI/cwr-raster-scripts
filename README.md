# PDI Raster Scripts

Scripts used for processing raster data for the Crop Wild Relatives of the US project and uploading them to the server.

## How to use

1. Create a directory called `C:\CWR` and put a folder containing rasters named `C:\CWR\srcSpeciesLevelData` in it.
1. Run all steps of the scripts automatically with `python3 run_all.py`.
1. Or, run an individual script with your own arguments by running itself with `python3 [script] <args>`.
